&lt;p&gt;My advice is adapted Dr. Shanafelt's blog, whose full and original post you should read first: &lt;a href="https://www.carrieshanafelt.com/asking-for-a-letter-of-recommendation/"&gt;https://www.carrieshanafelt.com/asking-for-a-letter-of-recommendation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, read the above post. Do not treat letters of recommendations like a chore or a box to be ticked; they are an opportunity that you should use in your favor. Reflect on what you think I could reasonably say about you, and how it could be strategically helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice is adapted Dr. Shanafelt's blog, whose full and original post you should read first: &lt;a href="https://www.carrieshanafelt.com/asking-for-a-letter-of-recommendation/"&gt;https://www.carrieshanafelt.com/asking-for-a-letter-of-recommendation/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, read the above post. Do not treat letters of recommendations like a chore or a box to be ticked; they are an opportunity that you should use in your favor. Reflect on what you think I could reasonably say about you, and how it could be strategically helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, if your only real relationship with me is that I'm your major advisor, then I am not in the position to write for you what I consider a 'strong recommendation' --- as your advisor, I advise you to reflect harder and ask someone whose perspective on your work would take better advantage of the opportunity afforded by a letter of recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel prepared to write me a request, begin your draft e-mail, making sure to follow that advice while also covering these  points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&lt;/strong&gt;. Remind me when you took my class and what class it was, or otherwise in what capacity you've worked with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context&lt;/strong&gt;. Explain the program or position you are applying to and why it is important to you in terms of your life's goals. Let me know why this opportunity and/or your goals are important to you, to your family, or to your community. Be sincere. (If I think I'm an appropriate person to write a recommendation for you, I may use this context when I talk about you.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why me&lt;/strong&gt;. Explain why this recommendation should come from &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, rather than another professor in whose class you did well.&lt;br&gt;
 For example, how is the course you took with me relevant? How are the skills you demonstrated in my class relevant? How are the projects you did in my class relevant? 
 If you are using multiple recommendations, explain who else you are asking and how my recommendation would fit into that portfolio of recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;. Give me all the logistics up front: (i) when is it due, (ii) how do I submit the completed letter, and (iii) to whom is it going?&lt;br&gt;
 Give me a month's notice if possible. If you are running behind, be clear and apologetic.&lt;br&gt;
 Give me everything I would need to write a professional letter: if it goes to a person, I need their full name and title/position; if it gets mailed, I need the address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attachments&lt;/strong&gt;. Attach your resume/CV. Attach any draft materials you are submiting. Give me a link to any online information abount the opportunity you are pursuing. Tell me what each link and attachment is. If you don't have these things immediately, promise me up front &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you can give me and &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you will give it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you hit send: proofread and spellcheck; read your email aloud; make sure your opening and closing are professional and express gratititude; double-check it is going to my SSU email address; give the email a a good subject line (like "Request for recommendation for [purpose]") then hit send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, it is unprofessional to ask me for a copy of the recommendation after I have submitted it. You may be curious, but unless I make the offer to send you a copy, do not ask.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="2018"></category><category term="advising"></category><category term="teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>Asking for a permission number</title><link href="//www.gondree.com/article/asking-for-a-permission-number.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Mark Gondree</name></author><id>tag:www.gondree.com,2018-12-31:/article/asking-for-a-permission-number.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If I have directed you to this page, it is because you requested a permission number (PN) from me as your advisor, but I need more information.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Noteworthy Situations &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of these situation apply to you, mention it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pre-req is a course I never took at SSU but passed at another college.  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it show up in your transfer report?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it appear on your ARR as credit for the pre-req?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pre-req is a course I took 3 or more times before I passed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pre-req is a course I repeated, but at another college&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Things PNs don't fix &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waitlists.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorry, my PNs won't get you off a waitlist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: talk to the instructor. They may know how to help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time conflicts. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorry, my PNs won't resolve time conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: do time conflict paperwork with the instructors of the conflicted classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking courses out of order&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorry, my PNs won't let you fudge pre-reqs, or turn pre-reqs into co-reqs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: talk to the instructor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overriding credit units caps.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sorry, my PNs won't let you sign up for more units than you are allowed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solution: do the paperwork to petition for extra units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am happy to meet with you if I am available. Your request needs to save us both time, by following the guidance below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greeting&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with a profesisonal greeting.&lt;br&gt;
  If you missed a meeting we had previously scheduled and you are trying to schedule another one, be incredibly apologetic.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greeting&lt;/strong&gt;. Start with a profesisonal greeting.&lt;br&gt;
  If you missed a meeting we had previously scheduled and you are trying to schedule another one, be incredibly apologetic.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. What is this about? Did I ask you to schedule the meeting? If so, remind me. Otherwise, you should have a fair idea of what you hope to achieve in a meeting. Be brief (1--3 sentences).&lt;br&gt;
  If you are really stressed out about something, take a breath and consider writing this email when you are calmer. Paniced emails are likely to make me worry about your immediate health and safety and refer you to counseling before we schedule a meeting about less important things, like class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Office Hours&lt;/strong&gt;. Acknowledge that you know my office hours and have a conflict. It communicates to me that you took the time to familiarize yourself with my office hours before asking for a special meeting. A simple sentence like this is sufficient: "&lt;em&gt;I would come to your office hours but my POLS120 class conflicts with your Sat 9pm--11pm office hours, and my work schedule conficts with your Sun 3am--4am office hours.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask clearly&lt;/strong&gt;. Ask for the meeting, and immediately list 3--4 different meeting options when you are free to meet. I will pick among these, if I am able. Be clear about each date, giving ranges for times (not just start times).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recipient and Subject&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure the email is to my SSU email. Use a subject line that communicates the purpose, like: &lt;em&gt;"Meeting about [purpose] for [course name]."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double check your e-mail before hitting send. Specifically, avoid these pitfalls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not overstate your availability.&lt;br&gt;
  Ex: "&lt;em&gt;I'm free all Wed&lt;/em&gt;" is likely an exaggeration. Just list a date with time ranges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not propose a time when you don't want to meet.&lt;br&gt;
  Ex: "&lt;em&gt;I'm free Tue 7/2 from 12--1, but that is my only lunch time during the day and skipping lunch really throws me off...&lt;/em&gt;". Please, just don't list that as a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List meeting options that are functionally different.&lt;br&gt;
  Ex 1. "&lt;em&gt;I'm free Mon 7/1 at 3--4pm, Mon 7/8 at 3--4pm and Mon 7/15 at 3--4pm&lt;/em&gt;". Most conflicts are recurring. These times are probably functionally the same; list more times.&lt;br&gt;
  Ex 2. "&lt;em&gt;I'm free Mon 7/1 at 3--4p and Wed 7/3 3--4pm&lt;/em&gt;". &lt;br&gt;
The way M/W and T/Th class blocks work, if I conflict with one then it is likely I conflict with both. These times are probably functionally the same; list more times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not ask me to list when I am free.&lt;br&gt;
  It would be nice if profs just wrote out all their availability for you, and you picked from that list. Asking me to do that commmunicates huge disrespect for my time. That said, I have made scheduling easier for you though: you can &lt;a href="/calendar"&gt;peek at my busy/free calendar online&lt;/a&gt;, but you still need to list meeting options for me in your email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not be presumptuous.&lt;br&gt;
  Do not say "&lt;em&gt;Oh, you look free Mon 7/1 at 2pm on your calendar, so can we meet then?&lt;/em&gt;" or, "&lt;em&gt;Oh, I know you usually go to colloquium but it is cancelled this week, so can we meet then?&lt;/em&gt;" Your guess may be a good one, but let &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; make that decision. Please, just list meeting options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
