At the end of Summer 2025, I will be stepping down as the chair of CS.
I will be starting a difference-in-pay (DIP) leave during Academic Year 2025-2026, a type of [sabbatical leave](https://academicaffairs.sonoma.edu/faculty-affairs/all-faculty/sabbatical-and-difference-pay-leaves). Stay turned to learn about my sabbatical project when I return to SSU in Fall 2026.
