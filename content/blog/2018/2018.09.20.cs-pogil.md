Dr. Gurman Gill (SSU) and I are both participants in the [IntroCS POGIL](http://cspogil.org/IntroCS%20POGIL%20Project).

I did a 4-day POGIL workshop in at Manhattan College, NY over the Summer of 2018. We will both be integrating POGIL activities into our CS1 classes during 2018--2019. I'm very excited and encourage you to look at the materials the project has already released for various CS core classes: [http://cspogil.org](http://cspogil.org)
