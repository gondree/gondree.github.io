Dr. Gurman Gill and I have been working over the past year as part of a cohort sponsored under a CSU Course Redesign with Technology grant, with the goal of improving student outcomes in our CS1 class. 

The results of the [CRT grants in computer science are available as a set of e-portfolios](https://oep.merlot.org/eports_computer_science.html) online. In particular, [my e-portfolio is among them](https://contentbuilder.merlot.org/toolkit/html/snapshot.php?id=9408850948707062).
