We had a great time at [2018 USENIX Workshop on Advances in Security Education](https://www.usenix.org/conference/ase18) (ASE'18), August 13, 2018, co-located with USENIX Security in Baltimore, MD. The program is up at [https://www.usenix.org/conference/ase18/workshop-program](https://www.usenix.org/conference/ase18/workshop-program). Wonderful papers, and an exciting demo of WPI's K-12 Cyber Sleuth Escape Room activity. Very cool!
