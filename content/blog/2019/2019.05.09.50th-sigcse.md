<img class="pull-right" src="/images/SIGCSE-logo-small-trans.gif" style="padding: 10px; height: 100px;" alt="SIGCSE Logo" />Thank you to the SIGCSE Board for awarding me one of the [50 travel grants](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/programs/travel-grants/awards) (in honor of the 50th SIGCSE) to attend SIGCSE in Minneapolis. It was my first time attending! My picture is in the [SIGCSE bulletin](https://sigcse.org/sigcse/files/bulletin/bulletin.51.2.pdf) with the other 49 recipients. (It is a bit of a where's Waldo image, as you can see below).


Not only did I get to see old friends who settled in teaching colleges and security education friends who do SIGCSE annually, but I got a lot of ideas for the [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2019), which will be [celebrating its 40th anniversary](https://ieee-security.org/TC/SP2019/40th.html) while I'm general chair.
