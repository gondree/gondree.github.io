SSU has recently started its first course for the first cohort of the [CS Supplementary Authorization program](https://education.sonoma.edu/programs/current-practicing-teachers), a graduate-level program for in-service teachers to obtain the CS Supplementary Authorization credential from CTC.

I am the CSSA program director of the SSU program, which is a collaboration with the SSU CS Department, SSU STEM Teacher Education Pathways (STEP) Center, and the CSUâ€™s Math and Science Teacher Initiative (MSTI) program.

We are one of four CSUs participanting in the CS4NorthCal project under [NSF grant \#2219495](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2219495&HistoricalAwards=false).
