I recently completed a summer writing program supported by the [IntroCS POGIL](http://cspogil.org/IntroCS%20POGIL%20Project) Project (NSF Award 1626765). It was the most productive writing programs I have ever encountered, in part due to the summer-long duration and its responsive mentorship and review teams. 

The results of that work have been released as a special edition of the POGIL Activity Clearinghouse: [PAC Vol. 3, No. 4](http://pac.chem.pitt.edu/index.php/pac/issue/view/19). 
Five of my activities were accepted through peer review into the issue. (Again, it was a *very* productive writing program!)
