I recently helped SSU become a member of the Academic Alliance of the National Center for Womeen & Information Technlogy. Our goal is for our SSU's CS population to reflect SSU's diversity. As a step toward this goal, I am the PI on a CSU [CRT grant](http://courseredesign.csuprojects.org/wp/) related to improvements of our introductory CS course, intended to address factors contributing to an achievement gap. I am excited to begin this important work, and join this tremendous community.
