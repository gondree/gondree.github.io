Summary: My student Grayson Blanks presented at the CS Colloquium with his own research project, exploring the performance of a parallelized PRNG test suite that is under development. I'm excited to see Zhibin Zhang's prior thesis work from NPS evolve into Grason's work at SSU -- in particular, I'm really impressed to see an *undergrad* at SSU continuing the work of my former *Master's thesis* students. Grayson's talk is below.
