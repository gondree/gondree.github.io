My student Francisco's thesis work turned into a CVE. Well, its reserved as [CVE-2017-7924](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7924) and may take some time to go up, but its discussed in DHS-ICS advisory [ICSA-17-138-03](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-138-03). Our first CVE. Its a modest little single-packet DoS attack against the MicroLogix 1100, but pretty exciting for us!
