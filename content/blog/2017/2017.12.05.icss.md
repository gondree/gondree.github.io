Our work "DoS Exploitation of Allen-Bradley's Legacy Protocol through Fuzz Testing"is appearing at the [Industrial Control System Security Workshop](https://www.acsac.org/2017/workshops/icss/) (ICSS) co-located with [ACSAC'17](https://www.acsac.org/2017/) in Orlando, Florida. Franciso will be presenting our work, now that DHS has cleared all the details through responsible disclosure. Good luck, Cisco!
