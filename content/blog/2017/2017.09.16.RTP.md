My RTP File is located online, hosted on Google Drive.

Members any committee involved in my RTP process can access my RTP File by following these steps:

1. Login to Google Drive using your SSU account: [https://drive.google.com/a/sonoma.edu](https://drive.google.com/a/sonoma.edu)
2. Follow this link to access my RTP File at [https://goo.gl/N6Eysu](https://goo.gl/N6Eysu).
3. When prompted by Google Drive, click "Request access". I will then add you to the list of people authorized to access my RTP materials.

Alternatively, the CS Dept. AC has read acess to my RTP file. So, if you are a member of a committee involved in my RTP process: you may request the CS AC print any item listed on my RTP Index and deliver it via campus mail to you.
