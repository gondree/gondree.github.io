This year, we did a [virtual science and technology research symposium](https://orsp.sonoma.edu/training-and-events/gallery) again. [Sean and Max](https://orsp.sonoma.edu/training-and-events/gallery/exposing-prng-test-suites-python) did and excellent job fighting burnout after a very long semester, and presented their work!
