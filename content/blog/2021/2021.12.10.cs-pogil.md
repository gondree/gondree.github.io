I'm very excited to be contributing back to the [CS POGIL project](http://cspogil.org/IntroCS%20POGIL%20Project) by releasing activities under a CC-BY license into the public. I'd love feedback on them! All my activities can be found at [https://cspogil.org/Mark+Gondree](https://cspogil.org/Mark+Gondree). So far, I have released several Computer Logic and Organization activities using ARM, based on the fabulous activities of Cliff Kussmaul.
