I'm honored to be included in the [TIPS for Justice](http://orsp.sonoma.edu/awards/transformative-inclusion-postsecondary-stem-towards-justice-tips-towards-justice) grant (co-PIs Dr. Brigitte Lahme, Dr. Benjamin Ford, Dr. Omayra Ortega) as a CS participant. The grant's goal is to build a culture of radical inclusion to transform our institution and STEM department into one who takes the "serving" part of our HSI status as a first-order priorty. We've been meeting with each other in a series of conversations facilitated by Dr. Aris Winger, who has really challenged us in a number of critical ways. I am very fortunate to have peers who inspire and challenge me.
