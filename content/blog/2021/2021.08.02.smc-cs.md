The SSU CS department is helping expand the Koret-supported [Sonoma Mountain Connection](https://scitech.sonoma.edu/college-beyond/sonoma-mountain-connection) program to include computer science. This is a unique interdisplinary program designed to promote student success in early-career STEM fields, providing mentors, support and enrichment during their first year at SSU. I'm happy to support and help develop the program!
