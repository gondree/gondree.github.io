I was excited to present in special session at SIGCSE devoted to NCWIT's [EngageCSEdu](https://www.engage-csedu.org/) program, and discuss [my AQI assignment](https://www.engage-csedu.org/find-resources/air-quality-index-calculator), which recently was awarded an [Engagement Excellence award](https://www.ncwit.org/project/ncwit-engagecsedu-engagement-excellence-awards).

A few [hours before my talk](https://whova.com/embedded/session/sigcs_202003/871520/), the mayor of Portland cancelled all gatherings of over 500 people, and I hopped on a flight back home. I've decided to put my slide-deck online and add speaker notes, as a substitute!
