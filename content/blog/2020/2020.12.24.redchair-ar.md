We've been participating in NCWIT's [Sit With Me](https://www.sitwithme.org/) campaign through [SSU's Women in Tech](https://scitech.sonoma.edu/wit/sit-with-me) group over the past year. 

When we went virtual, I decided to publish a Spark AR filter for instagram stories, so you can have the red chair in your living room, or grow it the size of a house. You can scale it to reflect how much room your organization is willing to make at the table for women in technology!
