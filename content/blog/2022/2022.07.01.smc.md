Prof. St. John (Biology) and I co-taught an interdisplinary seminar in Spring 2022. Our students were extremely good sports about engaging in this experimental course offering, working together in CS/Biology teams to explore using technology to build virtual interpretive nature experiences. [Our students' Spring 2022 e-portfolios are available](https://smc.cs.sonoma.edu/S22/) online.
