I am honored and humbled to be recognized with SSU's 2022-2023 Excellence in Teaching Award. This award at SSU can only be received by a faculty member once in their career.I am in very good company, considering the amazing [past recipients of this award](https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/faculty-staff/outstanding-faculty/Pages/Profiles.aspx?Campus=Sonoma).

Relatedly, the SSU Center for Teaching & Educational Technology (CTET) has interviewed me as their first [Faculty Spotlight series](https://ctet.sonoma.edu/faculty-spotlight-mark-gondree).

I also ran a small CTET workshop on the topic of "[Reviewing your Syllabus for Inclusion and Justice](https://ctet.sonoma.edu/workshops/tls-teaching-spotlight-series-mark-gondree-reviewing-your-syllabus-inclusion-and-justice)"
