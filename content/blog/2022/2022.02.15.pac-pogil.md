I have recently contributed to the POGIL Activity Clearinghouse: my activity for Operating Systems was accepted into [the PAC Vol. 3, No. 1](http://pac.chem.pitt.edu/index.php/pac/issue/view/16) through their collaborative peer review process. If you are using POGIL in your classroom, my activity is available for more testing, but you must join the PAC for access. You can reach out to me for access otherwise.
