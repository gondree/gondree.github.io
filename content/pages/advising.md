Title: Academic Advising
Slug: advising
save_as: advising.html

If I am your advisor, then we should talk at least once a semester. Be aware that I don't do walk-ins or same-day appointments, because I need to familiarize myself with your file to serve you better. So, you need to sign-up for a meeting  **at least 24 hours in advance**.

## Get an appointment
To arrange a meeting, go to [my meeting](/meet) page.

**Before your appointment**: Prepare and write down your questions, and review your ARR.

## Be a Student-Scholar
If you are a student and interested in working with me on research, then e-mail me. It is always useful to start such a conversation by discussing a paper or prior research work of mine about which you are interested, rather than a vague "hey, you work on neat stuff --- I want to do that too." Try to read something I've written that interests you, and then ask me questions. 

Most everything I've written, or my students have written, have future work sections! So, if you want inspiration, prior projects and theses with which I was involved can be located:

 - via GoogleScholar, [gondree @ GoogleScholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dyee0SUAAAAJ)
 - via Calhoun, [gondree @ NPS-Calhoun](http://calhoun.nps.edu/discover?query=gondree&rpp=10&filtertype=advisor&filter_relational_operator=contains&filter=Gondree).
